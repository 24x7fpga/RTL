#+title: Icarus Verilog and GTKWave

[[https://bleyer.org/icarus/][Icarus Verilog]] is an open-source Verilog simulation and synthesis tool. It's useful for simulating Verilog code and checking the functionality of digital designs. 

[[https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/][GTKwave]] is a waveform viewer that is commonly used to visualize the simulation output from various digital design tools along with Icarus Verilog. 

A [[https://github.com/24x7fpga/PythonScripts/blob/master/iVerilog/iv_design.py][Python script]] was developed to generate the project folder structure and design blueprints in SystemVerilog/Verilog. Additionally, a [[https://github.com/24x7fpga/PythonScripts/blob/master/iVerilog/iv_run.py][run script]] is used for simulating the design using Icarus Verilog and to visualize the output using GTKwave.
