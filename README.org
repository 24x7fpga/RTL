#+title: Icarus Verilog and GTKWave

[Icarus Verilog](https://bleyer.org/icarus/) is an open-source Verilog simulation and synthesis tool. It's useful for simulating Verilog code and checking the functionality of digital designs. 

[GTKwave](https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) is a waveform viewer that is commonly used to visualize the simulation output from various digital design tools along with Icarus Verilog.
